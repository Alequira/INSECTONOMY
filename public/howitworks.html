                        <p>At Insectonomy.org, we apply a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to explore and manage the roles of insects in sustainable agrifood systems. Our research framework integrates unsupervised machine learning methods to evaluate insect species across different dimensions, focusing on their productive potential, ecosystem potential, use potential, and the challenges they pose.</p>
                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>Insects provide critical socio-ecological roles, and their sustainable use can contribute to solving global challenges in food production, biodiversity conservation, and economic development. However, harnessing their full potential requires careful evaluation of each species' roles in various ecosystems and their ability to meet human needs. Our framework assesses these roles by considering productive, ecological, and social factors while addressing potential challenges like regulatory issues and public acceptance.</p>
                        <p>Since quantitative information regarding insects' socio-ecological roles is scarce and there are many gaps, a transdisciplinary team of experts in animal sciences, biology, and engineering proposes a qualitative approach to evaluate the productive potential, ecosystem potential, use, and challenges of insect species.</p>
                        <p>We define:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Productive Potential (PP)</b> as the insect's ability to be used for productive purposes in agriculture or insect farming.</li>
                            <li><b>Ecosystem Potential (EP) </b> as the insect's contribution to ecological systems and processes.</li>
                            <li><b>Use (U)</b> as the insect's ability to meet human needs and preferences through practical, cultural, and environmental applications.</li>
                            <li><b>Challenges (C)</b> as the obstacles and risks insects pose, including regulatory barriers, pests, toxins, and public acceptance issues.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Methods</h3>
                        <p>We employed unsupervised machine learning to analyze a dataset of 120 insect species from across the globe. This method allows us to uncover non-trivial relationships between data points, grouping insect species based on similar characteristics without needing pre-labeled outcomes. Our approach clusters insects according to their roles in agrifood systems, providing insights into their potential for use, ecological contributions, and challenges they might pose.</p>
                        <h3>Variables Used</h3>
                        <p>
                            To evaluate each species, we categorized them into four key areas, with the following variables for assessing Use, Productive Potential, Ecosystem Potential, and Challenges in the study.
