                    <h2>Research </h2>
                    <p>Insects offer immense potential—high productivity, environmental benefits, economic viability, and social impact—yet much of this remains untapped. Our comprehensive framework evaluates insect species based on productivity, ecosystem contributions, and challenges, aiming to reshape responsible management, contribute to public policy development, and support the shift towards circular, sustainable food systems.

                        Join us in building an interdisciplinary platform where researchers, farmers, policymakers, and innovators collaborate to unlock the potential of insects in agrifood systems. As Eduardo Galeano wisely said, "Many small people, in small places, doing small things, can change the world."
                        
                        Join us at Insectonomy.org as we work to redefine approaches to insect management in more efficient, collaborative, and holistic ways.

                    <h3>Abstract </h3>
                    <p>The global agrifood system faces unprecedented challenges due to resource constraints, environmental degradation, and biodiversity loss. Given their many ecological functions, insects may provide nature-based solutions to these problems as they provide four major categories of multiple ecosystem services:  provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. This article seeks to redefine the roles of insects in agrifood systems, moving beyond the anthropocentric concepts of ecosystem services and disservices. We propose a holistic framework that recognizes the intrinsic value of all insects in maintaining ecological balance, supporting human well-being, and addressing agrifood system challenges. By connecting this intrinsic value of insects with diverse insect management strategies and stakeholder perspectives, we aim to optimize the beneficial roles of insects and mitigate challenges in a way that contribute to sustainability, food security, preservation of cultural heritage and harmonious coexistence. This article explores the diversity of insect management strategies, including conservation strategies, insect pest-vector control, wild insect gathering, and insect husbandry. Challenges and opportunities associated with these strategies are discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration, stakeholder interaction, community engagement, and policy support to achieve sustainability.</p>
