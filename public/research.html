                <h2>Welcome to our community!</h2>
                <p>Insectonomy.org invites experts from various insect disciplines to join our open science community. Our project aims to address challenges in the agricultural and food system, transitioning from a linear economy to a more sustainable circular approach.</p>

                <p>Insects present a compelling alternative due to their high productivity, economic advantages, and environmental benefits. While insect farming has expanded, it primarily focuses on a limited number of species, overlooking the diversity of over 2,000 identified edible insect species, each with its unique characteristics. Moreover, the emphasis on large-scale insect farming neglects the socio-economic and gender inclusion benefits of small and medium-scale farming, particularly in the global South.</p>
                    
                <p>Insects offer valuable ecosystem services, such as pollination, biocontrol, food and feed production, and bioconversion, aligning with multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To fully harness their potential, we need a comprehensive approach that considers economic, social, and environmental dimensions, adaptable to diverse contexts.</p>
                    
                <p>Our analytical framework evaluates insect species based on productivity, ecosystem potential, and sustainability, considering geographical and biological factors. This framework informs decision-making, responsible management, and the transition towards a circular agricultural and food system through insect utilization.</p>
                    
                <p>By promoting local and regional development, respecting planetary boundaries, and ensuring cultural acceptance, we can maximize insect benefits while minimizing environmental impact. This approach leads to adaptable, circular, and sustainable agricultural and food systems, addressing real-world challenges effectively.</p>
                    
                <p>Join us at insectonomy.org to be part of this transformative journey</p>
