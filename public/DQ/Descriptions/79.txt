Harmonia axyridis is a large lady beetle or ladybug species that is most commonly known as the harlequin, Asian, or multicoloured Asian lady beetle. This is one of the most variable species in the world, with an exceptionally wide range of colour forms.[1] It is native to eastern Asia, but has been artificially introduced to North America and Europe to control aphids and scale insects.
