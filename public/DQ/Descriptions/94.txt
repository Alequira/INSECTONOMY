Phyllophaga is a very large genus (more than 900 species) of New World scarab beetles in the subfamily Melolonthinae. Common names for this genus and many other related genera in the subfamily Melolonthinae are May beetles, June bugs, and July beetles.
They range in size from 12 to 35 mm (0.47 to 1.38 in) and are blackish or reddish-brown in colour, without prominent markings, and often rather hairy ventrally. These beetles are nocturnal, and are attracted to artificial lights in great numbers...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllophaga#:~:text=They%20range%20in%20size%20from,artificial%20lights%20in%20great%20numbers.">Learn more</a>
