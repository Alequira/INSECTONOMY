Blaptica dubia, the dubia roach, orange-spotted roach, Guyana spotted roach, or Argentinian wood roach, is a medium-sized species of cockroach which grows to around 40–45 mm (1.6–1.8 in).
They are sexually dimorphic; adult males have full wings covering their body, while females have only tiny wing stubs - their tegmina (forewings) being around a fourth of their body length. Adults are dark brown to black with somewhat lighter orange spot/stripe patterning sometimes visible only in bright light. Coloration differs slightly with environment and diet from one colony to another...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaptica_dubia">Learn more</a>
