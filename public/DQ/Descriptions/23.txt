The Japanese rhinoceros beetle (Allomyrina dichotoma), also known as the Japanese rhino beetle, the Japanese horned beetle, or by its Japanese name kabutomushi (甲虫 or カブトムシ), is a species of rhinoceros beetle. They are commonly found in continental Asia in countries such as China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, and Taiwan.
In these areas, this species of beetle is often found in broad-leaved forests with tropical or sub-tropical climates.This beetle is well known for the prominent cephalic horn found on males. Male Japanese rhinoceros beetles will use this horn to fight other males for territory and access to female mating partners. Upon contact, males will attempt to flip each other onto their backs or off of their feeding tree. 
In response to selective pressures, smaller male A. dichotoma have adapted a "sneak-like behavior". These smaller beetles will attempt to avoid physical confrontation with larger males and try to mate with females...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rhinoceros_beetle">Learn more</a>
