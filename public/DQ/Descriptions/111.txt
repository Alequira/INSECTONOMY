Rhodnius prolixus is the principal triatomine vector of the Chagas parasite due to both its sylvatic and domestic populations in northern South America as well as to its exclusively domestic populations in Central America. It has a wide range of ecotopes, mainly savanna and foothills with an altitude of between 500 and 1,500 metres (1,640 and 4,921 ft) above sea level and temperatures of 16 to 28 °C (61 to 82 °F).
