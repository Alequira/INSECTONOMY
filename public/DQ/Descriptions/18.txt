Zophobas morio is a species of darkling beetle, whose larvae are known by the common name superworm, kingworm, barley worm, morio worm or simply Zophobas. Superworms are common in the reptile pet industry as food, along with giant mealworms (Tenebrio molitor larvae treated with juvenile hormone).
The larvae resemble very large mealworms, about 50 to 60 mm (1.7–2.25 in) long when full size, but unlike mealworms, the ends of their bodies are very dark, almost resembling a black color. Once they reach sufficient maturity, the larvae pupate, emerging with a white to light brown colour; eventually darkening to black. The larvae fail to pupate if kept in a high density with many other larvae and plentiful food. Keeping Z. morio this way is commonly used to hinder pupation. To mature the larvae, they must be isolated for about 7–10 days...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zophobas_morio">Learn more</a>
