Lampyris noctiluca, the common glow-worm of Europe (see also "glowworm"), is the type species of beetle in the genus Lampyris and the family Lampyridae.
Lampyris noctiluca presents a conspicuous sexual dimorphism. The males are winged, with brown elytra, a clearer pronotum and a large brown spot in the middle, while females are larviform, wings are missing and they are often twice the size of the males (up to 25 millimetres or 1 inch in length)...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lampyris_noctiluca">Learn more</a>
