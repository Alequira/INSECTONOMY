Messor barbarus is a species of harvester ant in the subfamily Myrmicinae. It is found In Southern Europe and Northern Africa.
Messor barbarus causes 50â€“100% of the seed losses and is the most common ant in arable fields in northeastern Spain (Westerman et al. 2012). These ants in particular made news headlines all over Spain when farmers believed they were stealing their seeds and began a cull only to realise they actually play a massive part of the ecosystem and benefit the production for crop farmers completely. Messors will carry the seeds on their own roads back to the colony, sometimes up to 100ft away...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messor_barbarus">Learn more</a>
