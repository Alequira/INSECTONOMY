Blaberus discoidalis, commonly known as the discoid cockroach,tropical cockroach,West Indian leaf cockroach,false death's head cockroach,Haitian cockroach, and drummer, is a cockroach native to Central America of the "giant cockroach" family, Blaberidae.

The adult is around 35–45 mm (1.4–1.8 in) in length, and is tan with a dark brown to black patch on its pronotum. The juvenile is brown with tan speckles, and matures to adulthood in 4–5 months.Adults have wings but are not active fliers,and they can not climb smooth vertical surfaces, simplifying their care in captivity.

Blaberus discoidalis is called the false death's head cockroach because of its superficial resemblance to the death's head cockroach, Blaberus craniifer.
