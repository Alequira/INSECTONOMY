Hypoderma tarandi, also known as the reindeer warble fly and reindeer botfly, is a species of warble fly that is parasitic on reindeer.
The larvae of this fly are a skin-penetrating ectoparasite that usually infest populations of reindeer and caribou in Arctic areas, causing harm to the hides, meat and milk in domesticated herds. They also may cause ophthalmomyiasis in humans, leading to uveitis, glaucoma and retinal detachment. H. lineatum and H. sinense may also infest humans...<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoderma_tarandi">Learn more</a>
